fed-reference
==============

A minimalistic curated list of references on Front-End Development.

If you're looking for the "blow my mind" type of lists, check out [Awesome - Front-End Development](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#front-end-development).  
If you're looking for a resource to study from, [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) is an excellent one.

Purpose
---------

To provide high quality reference links for the essential topics a developer has to study to become an effective Front-End Developer, **without getting lost**.

Why?
-----

The internet is a vast universe of information, and when you are just learning Front-End Development, it's easy to get overwhelmed or follow bad practices just because they show up first on Google.

This list was built by professional developers and teachers as part of several extensive FED courses to serve as a reference to studied materials.

Contributing
-------------

Like any work in our field, this list can get outdated pretty quickly.

If you notice a link that's no longer relevant or you have a resource you'd like to suggest, just open an Issue or PR and we'll check it out.

### Key principles of a good resource

- Should be concise and to the point
- Should come from a credible source we can trust
- Should be relevant for today's practices
